  <h1 class="a">Hi There!</h1>
      <p>My name is Aaleeyah. I hope to be able to advance my front-end knowledge and use it to make projects of my own.
      Then also make acquaintances too. I became interested in programming because of discord bots. 
      This exposed me to Javascript and it's technologies I realized learning programming and 
      teaching others about concepts were enjoyable. Also I hope to explore front-end and back-end and 
      eventually decide which is ultimately for me!</p>

        <ul>My goals after graduatingâ€”including big goals:
          <li onmouseover="style.color='#80dfff'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">Gain experience through a job</li>
